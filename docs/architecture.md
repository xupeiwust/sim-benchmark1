# HWE-bench trial architecture & generality

How a single trial actually executes — and which parts of this design
extend to simulation domains beyond the ones we currently ship (see
[`../CASES.md`](../CASES.md) for the live list).

This doc is the level above the code: how the pieces fit, and a
first-principles read on which assumptions can travel. The hooks it used to
point at went with the self-built runner.

## Trial pipeline (left → right time)

Harbor owns this. `tools/run_harbor_trial.sh` picks a dataset, an agent
(`claude-code` / `codex` / `oracle` / `nop`) and a credential set; Harbor builds
the environment from `task.toml`'s `docker_image`, runs the agent in it, then
starts a **second** container for the verifier when the case declares
`environment_mode = "separate"`, and collects the paths named in `artifacts`.

```
harbor run -p <dataset> -a <agent> -o <jobs dir>
  │
  ├─ container 1: agent      reads instruction.md, drives the solver,
  │                          writes deliverables under /tmp/agent/submission
  │
  └─ container 2: verifier   re-extracts the KPIs from those deliverables and
     (network: none)         writes /logs/verifier/reward.json
```

What we own inside that is the case, the verifier library and the domain image —
not the loop. The harness layer and the two Claude Code hooks that used to sit
here were deleted with the self-built runner; `docs/infra_migration_plan.md`
records why, and the short version is that a hook was compensating for a case
defect rather than an agent one.

## Detector layer (post-stop, post-score)

The verifier (`score.py`) runs after the agent has stopped. It
computes scores, then dispatches the per-KPI score dicts through the
detector plugin layer (`lib/sim_benchmark_verifier/sim_benchmark_verifier/detectors/`).
Detectors emit two annotations onto each per-KPI entry — both are
**diagnostic-only metadata, not score components**.

| Axis | Values | Detector(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `provenance_stage` | P0_hallucination · P1_path_invalid · P2_extract_unrunnable · P3_extract_mismatch · P4_pass · spec_error | universal (single, solver-agnostic) |
| `solver_stage` | L0_input_syntax · L2_solver_crash · L3_convergence · L4_conservation · L5_physics · L5_quantitative · L6_pass · (open enum) | universal (L2/L5/L6 from KPI fields) + openfoam (L3/L4 from log scan) + ltspice (L2/L3 from log scan) + future per-solver |

Two-axis split solves a v3.1 confusion: provenance failures
("paperwork") and solver failures ("physics") need different fixes.
See `SCHEMA.md §6` for the full enum + back-compat with `failure_class`.

## First-principles generality analysis

The architecture above makes specific assumptions about what a
"simulation trial" looks like. Below: which assumptions actually
generalize to other domains, and which need extension.

### Strong assumptions (built into the contract)

#### A1. Output is one or more **scalar KPIs** with a deterministic extraction rule

Currently: `result.json = {kpi: {value: <number>, source: <how to re-extract>}}`.

| Domain | Fits? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Circuit / SPICE measurements (gain, f₃dB, settling time) | ✅ | Native fit — log files have scalar measures |
| CFD numerical KPIs (Cd, Cl, residual, max y+) | ✅ | Native fit |
| FEA stress / displacement at named locations | ✅ | Same shape — extract from solver's text output |
| EM frequency-response, S-parameters | ✅ | Scalar at chosen frequency |
| Robotics: collision count, path length, settling time | ✅ | Scalar from rosbag / sim log |
| **Field outputs (CFD vorticity field, FEA stress contour)** | ⚠️ | Single scalar reduction (max, integral, line-probe) fits; full field comparison needs different verifier |
| **Image outputs (camera frame from robotic sim, CAD render)** | ❌ | No scalar; would need perceptual similarity metric or LLM judge |
| **Time-series / trajectory (joint angles over time)** | ⚠️ | Reduce to scalar features (overshoot, settling time, RMS); the contract works, the case author has more upfront work |
| **Stochastic outputs (Monte Carlo, RL training reward)** | ⚠️ | Single trial returns a sample, and the tolerance band is binary — it accommodates **no** fuzz, so a sampling spread comparable to `pass_tol` scores at random. The fix is a KPI defined on the distribution (a quantile, a fixed-seed statistic), never a wider band: a band widened until both a right and a wrong answer pass has stopped measuring anything |

#### A2. Extraction is **re-runnable** by the verifier

Currently: agent declares `(value, source.path, source.extract)` →
verifier re-runs extract with file as stdin, asserts match.

| Source kind | Generalises to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `file_extract` (text file + UNIX pipeline) | Any text-format solver output | Most solvers; covers CFD logs, SPICE logs, structured text dumps |
| `ltspice_log` (LTspice native .log query) | LTspice variants (UTF-16 logs) | Solver-specific path; same pattern (custom parser per format) extends to e.g. CSV-only outputs, HDF5 outputs |
| `sim_run_*` (sim-cli's own record) | Anything that runs through sim-cli | Optional — most agents bypass |
| **Binary-format outputs (HDF5, VTK, ROS bag)** | Need adapter | New `source.kind` per format — e.g. `h5_extract` with HDF5 path query, `rosbag_query` with topic + time |
| **Image outputs** | Don't fit re-extraction model | Need similarity-metric verifier; outside this architecture |

#### A3. Workflow is **agent → solver → final state → verifier**

Currently: agent writes inputs, runs solver, writes `result.json`,
verifier scores once at the end.

| Workflow shape | Fits? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Batch CFD / SPICE / FEA (run once, score once) | ✅ | Native fit |
| Multi-step CAE (mesh → solve → post-process → judge) | ✅ | Multiple solver calls within one agent loop; verifier still scores once at end |
| **Interactive GUI (Fluent meshing workflow, COMSOL Desktop attach)** | ⚠️ | Agent does many small actions; verifier still scores final state. PreToolUse hooks could add per-step validation if needed. |
| **Closed-loop control (robot follows commanded trajectory)** | ⚠️ | KPI is final-state scalar (e.g. position error at t=T), so contract works; but the SIMULATION environment is more complex (need physics step + sensor feedback loop). Requires real-time sim platform inside the container. |
| **Multi-trial campaigns (Monte Carlo, parameter sweeps)** | ⚠️ | One trial = one sample; aggregate at harbor level via multiple trials. Doesn't break the architecture, but the per-trial score becomes statistical. |

#### A4. Time budget is **bounded per Bash call** (claude-code's 600s ceiling)

Currently: agent's bash calls each capped at ≤ 600s (claude-code
[issue #25881][1]). For longer sims, agent must use solver
checkpointing + multiple foreground calls, or `run_in_background=true`.

[1]: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25881

| Sim wall-time | Pattern |
|---|---|
| < 5 min | Single foreground call. Default. |
| 5 – 30 min | `run_in_background=true` + claude-code's output-polling tool. Hook auto-skips wrapping for background mode. |
| > 30 min | Solver checkpointing (`writeInterval` for OF, `RESTART_SOL=YES` for SU2) + multiple foreground calls. Each retry continues from previous endpoint. |
| > 1 day | Doesn't fit at all. The trial container itself is bounded by harbor's `agent.timeout_s × timeout_multiplier`. Architecture would need a different runtime (job queue + checkpoint orchestration). |

#### A5. Agent framework is whatever Harbor can drive

This assumption **was** "the agent framework is claude-code", and it is no longer
true: the board carries a `codex` row beside the `claude-code` ones, and the two
differ in ways that reach the measurement. The live example is the turn budget —
`claude_code` exposes `max_turns`, `codex` exposes no such flag, so a 60-turn cap
applied to one and not the other inflated the codex row's lead until every capped
trial was re-run without it.

So the assumption that survives is weaker and worth stating plainly: **a task
must be answerable by any agent Harbor can drive, and any budget we impose must
be expressible for all of them.** A budget only one framework understands is not
a measurement parameter, it is a handicap on the others.

### Things that travel cleanly across simulation domains

Independent of the assumptions above:

- **Source-provenance verification.** "Re-extract from declared
  source" works for any deterministic output. New `source.kind` per
  format.
- **Two-axis failure attribution** (`provenance_stage` ×
  `solver_stage`). Provenance axis is solver-agnostic. Solver axis
  uses per-domain detector plugins; the universal stages (L0 / L2 /
  L5 / L6) apply to every solver, domain-specific stages get added
  per-detector.
- **Calibration discipline.** Real broken/healthy fixture pairs +
  TPR/FPR validation per detector. `EVIDENCE.md` template applies to
  any new domain.
- **Cost / wall / turns instrumentation.** `cost_meter.py` reads
  claude-code transcripts; agent-framework-specific but the *concept*
  (capture turn count + USD cost per trial) applies anywhere.

### Domains we'd need to extend the architecture for

Concrete examples of where the current scheme falls short:

| Domain | What breaks | Required extension |
|---|---|---|
| **Generative design (CAD shape from prompt)** | No scalar KPI for "is this shape good" | New verifier paradigm: design rules + manufacturability scoring + LLM-judge-with-rubric. Outside scope of this benchmark. |
| **Computer vision in robotics sim** | Image-output → no re-extractable scalar | New source kind: `image_metric` with reference image + similarity threshold. Verifier needs CV library. |
| **Autonomous driving sim** | Long-running real-time + closed-loop + safety-critical | Different runtime (CARLA/SUMO instead of Docker), different harness (real-time sim API vs shell), different verifier (trajectory + collision metrics). Architecturally a fork. |
| **Quantum circuit simulation** | Outputs are state-vector / density-matrix / shot histogram | New source kind: `quantum_state` with HDF5 / npz reader; KPI extracts measurement-basis probabilities. Numerical contract holds. |
| **Climate / weather** | Multi-day wall-clock, terabyte outputs | Doesn't fit container model; needs job-scheduler runtime + remote storage. |

The good news: the **first three layers (harness install, hooks,
verifier core)** generalise as long as we extend the source-kind set.
The runtime/infrastructure layer (claude-code, harbor, docker, 600s
ceiling) is the harder constraint.

## When the architecture is the right tool

Use it when:
- Output is a finite set of scalar KPIs extractable deterministically from solver artifacts
- Per-trial wall ≤ ~30 min (with checkpointing) or bounded enough for `run_in_background` polling
- Verification is rule-based, not human-judgment-based
- Solver runs in Linux (Docker) or via wine (LTspice / commercial via wrapper)

Don't force it when:
- The "right answer" requires human aesthetic judgment (shape, layout, design)
- Outputs are inherently non-scalar (full fields, images, trajectories without natural reductions)
- The simulation needs real-time stimulus / closed loops outside container's reach
- Single trials take > 1 day
