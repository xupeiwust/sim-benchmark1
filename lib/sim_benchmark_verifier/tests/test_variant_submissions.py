"""Verification (e): a submission that is NUMERICALLY RIGHT but written differently.

The case-PR bar checks two points on a line -- the oracle (must score exactly
1.0 since #359) and a deliberately broken run (must score < 0.5). Neither exercises the band in
between: a correct answer produced by a legitimately different route. Every one
of #68's three defects lives exactly there, and all three passed their oracle,
because the oracle never takes that route (#93).

Copying a template 39 times copies its blind spot 39 times, and (c)+(d) cannot
see it however often they run.

The combustion tests were `xfail(strict=True)` while #68's defects stood, and
battery's copy of the first of them (#138) sat there after that, so that a known
hole could not rot into a permanently-yellow test nobody reads. All are fixed and
no marker is left; what remains is the regression, and each test drives the real
code path rather than restating what the code says. A variant test that finds a
defect it is not allowed to fix goes back on `xfail(strict=True)` with the issue
number in its reason.

**One variant per shared evaluator covers every case that dispatches to it**,
and that is what makes (e) affordable: a case's `tests/verify*.py` is eight
lines around `from sim_benchmark_verifier.<module> import main_from_case`, so
the module is where the whole scoring chain lives and the module is where the
variant belongs. Four modules carry the live tracks today --
`native_cantera` (combustion), `native_pybamm` (battery),
`calculix_interface` (packaging), `openfoam_interface` (cfd) -- and
`test_every_shared_evaluator_has_a_variant_submission` discovers that list from
the cases themselves rather than restating it here, so the next generated
family is gated the day its first case lands.

That last test is the difference between this file and a one-off. #93's whole
finding is that a blind spot copied 39 times is invisible to (c)+(d); a list of
tracks maintained by hand is the same failure one level up.
