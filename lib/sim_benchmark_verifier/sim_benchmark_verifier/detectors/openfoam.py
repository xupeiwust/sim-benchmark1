"""OpenFOAM-specific solver-stage detector.

Reads ``log.<solver>`` files from the agent's workspace directly. Does
NOT depend on sim-cli having been called — discovery is purely
artifact-based (glob for ``log.<known_of_solver>`` under
``ctx.case_dir``).

Stages emitted:

  L3_convergence   solver killed mid-run (no ``End`` marker), OR last
                   time-step's final residual exceeds RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE.
  L4_conservation  max ``|local|`` continuity error across the run
                   exceeds CONTINUITY_TOLERANCE.

When the log gives no clear L3 / L4 signal (e.g. clean completion +
small residuals + small continuity error), this detector returns
``None`` — the universal detector then handles L5 / L6 from the KPI
score fields.

Thresholds are UNVALIDATED — Phase 4 calibration sets TPR/FPR targets
and records evidence in EVIDENCE.md. Adjust before promoting. Per
ccl-evaluator's convention, an unvalidated detector still runs but its
findings should be marked with caution in downstream reports.

# file declares about itself has to agree with what follows it. #377 priced the

# apart — calculix wanted a self-consistent FRD (a 21-line heredoc), openfoam
# wanted three files to exist (four lines of shell) — and the ruling on that

# the submission's setup — not a scheme, not a boundary condition, not a
# dictionary the agent chose. A run that solved cannot fail it however it was

    for what that means and why every entry either function looks at is part
    of the format rather than part of the submission's setup.

    What it is *not* is unforgeable — the entry point is arbitrary shell, and a
    submission willing to reimplement the writer can still satisfy it. No
    artifact predicate survives that, calculix's included; the evaluator's own
    strip-and-rerun is the defence, and this narrows the one hole rerunning
    leaves.
