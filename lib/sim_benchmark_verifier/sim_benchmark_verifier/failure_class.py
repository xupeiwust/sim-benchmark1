"""Two orthogonal failure-classification axes for per-KPI scoring outcomes.

Schema reward-v3.2 splits the v3.1 single ``failure_class`` enum into two
axes per KPI, both deterministic. Inspired by ccl-evaluator's L0–L6
design (see sim-proj #125 RFC). Each axis answers a different question:

  ``provenance_stage``  Did the agent honestly record what they got?
  ``solver_stage``      How far did the simulation make it?

A KPI emits **both** labels. The cross-product is the analytical signal:

  (L6_pass,            P3_extract_mismatch)  agent simulated correctly
                                              but recorded badly →
                                              fix SKILL prompt, not model
  (L3_convergence,     P4_pass)              agent honestly reports a
                                              non-converged value →
                                              fix model's numerics
  (L2_solver_crash,    P2_extract_unrunnable) cascading; root cause is L2

Backward compatibility: this module also emits the v3.1 ``failure_class``
field on each annotated entry (mapped from the new axes) so consumers
written against reward-v3.1 keep working until they migrate.

Trial-level codes (``wall_time`` / ``turn_cap`` / ``infra``) are NOT set
here — they need the harness transcript, populated post-hoc by an
aggregator. Per-KPI axes need only the verifier's output.
