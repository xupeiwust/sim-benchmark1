#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install_harness.sh — the COMMON substrate every per-domain fullstack
# image shares. Sourced (RUN bash) by every environment/domains/<d>/Dockerfile
# AFTER that domain's tools.sh has installed the domain toolchain.
#
# WHAT THIS INSTALLS (domain-agnostic):
#   - OS deps (curl/git/python/build-essential/...)
#   - sim-cli-core            (the uniform runtime + authenticity anchor)
#   - sim-benchmark-verifier  (the grader library, from pre-COPY'd /opt)
#   - sim-skills              (solver playbooks)
#   - Node 20 + claude-code + claude-code-router (the agent harness)
#   - openai_usage_proxy + ccr-plugins (token-recovery proxy, from /opt)
#   - the non-root `agent` user (UID 1200) Claude Code requires for
#     --permission-mode bypassPermissions
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO (domain-specific — lives in tools.sh):
#   - the domain solver toolchain (Yosys/ngspice/OpenFOAM/FreeCAD/ROS/...)
#   - any sim-cli plugin (sim-plugin-openfoam etc.) — tools.sh installs the
#     plugin matching its domain, tolerating absence (benchmark is
#     launcher-agnostic: agent may invoke the tool natively).
#
# CONTRACT WITH THE CALLING Dockerfile (must run BEFORE this script):
#   COPY lib/sim_benchmark_verifier /opt/sim-benchmark-verifier/
#   COPY tools/openai_usage_proxy.py /opt/openai_usage_proxy.py
#   COPY tools/ccr-plugins /opt/ccr-plugins/
#   (build context = repo root)
#
# TUNABLES (env vars; CN-friendly defaults):
#   SIM_CLI_REF       git ref for sim-cli-core            (default: main)
#   SIM_SKILLS_REF    git ref for sim-skills              (default: main)
#   PIP_INDEX_URL     pip mirror                          (default: TUNA)
#   NPM_REGISTRY      npm mirror                          (default: npmmirror)
#   NODE_TARBALL_URL  node 20 tarball                     (default: npmmirror)
#   GH_PROXY          github proxy prefix for git+https   (default: gh-proxy.com)
#   AGENT_UID         non-root agent uid                  (default: 1200)
#
# Idempotency: safe to re-run; apt/pip/npm skip already-installed items.
